# Xcode for debugging C code in macOs 

## Installation

Xcode is available via the Mac App Store free of charge for macOS Catalina users. If you have a previous version of macOS (Apple symbol at top-left corner, "about this Mac") you need to check which is the latest version of Xcode that your system supports [here](https://xcodereleases.com/). You can download the proper Xcode version [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode).
